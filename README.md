# GenericApp

Welcome to Ruby On HIGH SPEED Rails!  The GenericApp gem saves you time by automatically providing the basic 
elements and features that nearly all Rails apps require.  Instead of spending hours reinventing the wheel, you 
can spend more of your time on the more advanced features and capabilities that are unique to your specific Rails 
app.  Modifying a generic app takes far less time than creating an app from scratch.
<br><br>
Creating a basic generic web site with user capability and testing is a long and slow process that spans chapters 
3 through 10 at railstutorial.org.  The GenericApp Ruby gem allows you to create such a site in seconds instead of 
hours.  This is valuable for any project and essential for events like Startup Weekend and 24-hour website 
challenges.
<br><br>
The GenericApp gem copies the railstutorial.org Sample App for use as a template for starting a new project.  
(Note that the microposts and followers features are not included, because they are specific to the Sample App.)  
Starting a Rails app completely from scratch (by using the "rails new" command) requires manually installing and 
configuring MiniTest, Guard, Twitter bootstrap, the user model, user sign-ups, user login/logout, user 
authorization, administrative users, account activations, and password resets.  People are often tempted to "save 
time" by omitting testing.  Using the GenericApp gem allows you to have all of the essential basic elements of a 
generic app as soon as you start it.  It's a shortcut that actually complies with best practices.
